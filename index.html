		<h3>New single out!</h3>
		<p>Never Stop the Madness is out on
			<a href = "https://sebastianlaitila.bandcamp.com/track/never-stop-the-madness">Bandcamp</a> and <a href ="https://open.spotify.com/album/4TDYkBJDLWgmXsO7AZaaVR?si=OXKQwwhXQsaJuPRwW5fXbA" target="_blank">Spotify</a>
			along with other streaming services!</p>
		<p>This was originally supposed to be the first single of the an
			industrial metal album, but I had to rethink the concept after
			finding that the tracks were not all that strong, and also the
			style felt forced at some point. At the point when I made this,
			it did not feel, which is why I released it.</p>

		<p>I found my old tape recorder along with some cassettes I had recorded
			in the early 2000s. It featured The Kovenant and Pain among some other
			European industrial metal acts and proved to be an integral part of my
			music producer DNA. The track is very extra and unhinged, as I felt like
			not holding back much in it's presentation.
